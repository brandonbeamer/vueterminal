Overview

Whose Turn Is It is a django-based web app that helps groups who share responsibilities to keep track of, 
well, whose turn it is. This project was developed out of a real need for my
partner and I to keep track of whose turn it was to buy dinnerâ€”something we,
amazingly, had real difficulty keeping track of.

Implementation

  Python/Django

Features

 - Built-in user management
 - Support user-specific time zones
 - Creating tasks and inviting others to it via email
 - Recording comments on completed turns
 - Viewing shared task history
 - Responsive layout looks great on all screen sizes
